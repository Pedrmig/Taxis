# Analysis and Visualization Using the Seaborn Library's Taxi Dataset

## Objective
The main objective of this analysis is to explore and visualize the data from the Seaborn library's Taxi dataset. We aim to understand key insights and patterns through various graphical representations.

## Steps to Complete

### Explore the Dataset
- Understand the dataset structure, variable types, and distribution.
- Clean and prepare the dataset: Handle missing values, convert data types, and generate new variables if needed.

### Analyze the Dataset
- Extract meaningful and useful information using different data analysis techniques.

### Visualize the Data
- Create charts and diagrams to understand and communicate patterns and relationships within the data.

## Libraries to Use
- **Matplotlib**: For creating basic charts such as bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots.
- **Seaborn**: For creating more complex and visually appealing charts, leveraging its integration capabilities with pandas.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive charts that allow for deeper data exploration.
